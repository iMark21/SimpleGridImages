# SimpleGridImages

Each element in the grid must be an image obtained through the following URL: https://www.nicequest.com/portal_nicequest_api/DocumentServlet?docid=[[DOC_ID]] so you can use them in the app.

The scroll bar must not be shown, it's just there to point out that the view must be scrollable.

Make the scrolling smooth and limit the use of memory (an infinite scroll should not crash the app). It also shouldn't take long for the images to be displayed.
